# Computer-Graphics


## Description

A list of OpenGL programs using programming language C to demonstrate concepts of Computer Graphics. OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is the computer industry's standard API for defining 2-D and 3-D graphic images. 


## Configuration in Linux

Open up a terminal and run these commands

```
$ sudo apt-get upgrade && sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install freeglut3
$ sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev
```
For compilation and execution
```
$ gcc 'file-name.c' -o 'file-name' -lGL -lglut -lGLU
$ ./'file-name'
```
